    <h2>Information</h2>
      
      <p> When starting out the guitar, we learn from what is considered the bottom. 
        The string farthest from you. 
        So when you're ready, click on the "e string" to begin.<br>
        But first see below the strings for other guitar information, such as holding and basic tips. </p>

        <h2>How to Hold a Guitar</h2>
        <h3>Sitting</h3>
        <p>
          When sitting it is important to hold it in a way comfortable to you.
          Generally the curve in the guitar body will be rested on the right leg. 
          This is for optimal holding, in which your left arm will be used around the neck. 
          Generally when sitting you hold the guitar around the upper neck, near the first few frets. 
          Your right arm will rest over the guitar, in a way that your hand can easily strum up and down over the sound hole. <br><br>
          This is however assuming you are a right handed guitarist. 
          If you're not, flip directions (left leg rest, right arm for holding the neck, and left arm for strumming).<br><br>
          Images for reference will be added later!
        </p>
        <h3>Standing</h3>
        <p>
          When standing, it's hard to play if you don't have a strap. 
          It is possible, but you will have to figure out how to hold it while playing. 
          Without a strap, it is generally played by propping it on a leg.
          But straps are preferable, and when you are holding the guitar, it is generally the same as sitting, just minus resting on the leg.  
          Again comfort is pretty important. If it feels super awkward it may not be right positioning, or it may affect your playing.
         </p>
        
        <h2>Holding a Guitar Pick</h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/ff161e66-308e-4d64-be83-ff73094c4b3b%2FPickHolding.jpg?1550387643145" alt="Picture of how to hold a guitar" width="300" >
        <p>
          Guitar picks are a popular way to strum a guitar, and it's a general assumption that one can be used.
          To hold one you place the pic on your index finger the point facing down. 
          Then you place your thumb on the top half. The image above is how it is held.
