      <h1>E String</h1>
       <p>The E string is the sixth string, directly above the A string, and closest to you.
      By now you may have noticed that there are two "E" strings.
      One is uppercase, the one on this page, being the lowest, and the lowercase is the higher note.</p>

    <div class="E notes">

        <li>The F is played by holding a finger on the first fret.<br><br></li>
        <li>The G is played by holding a finger on the third fret. <br><br></li>
